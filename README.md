# 💪 Workout Planner in C++

This project is a simple and modular console application written in modern C++ designed to help plan workouts. It allows you to define exercises, group them into workouts, and manage your training schedule easily.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

This project was created as an educational tool to practice and learn how to use **smart pointers** in C++ (e.g., `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`). While the app itself functions as a workout planner, its primary goal is to demonstrate the practical application of modern C++ features, specifically intelligent memory management. It is not intended to showcase advanced development skills but rather to improve understanding and usage of C++ memory management techniques.

## 🏗️ Structure

The application is composed of the following key components:
- **Menu**: Handles the user interface and manages interaction with the planner.
- **Planner**: Stores and displays the list of workouts.
